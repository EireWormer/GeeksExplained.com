                <p>
                    When I built my first personal computer, I can remember the confusion of the entire process. 
                    There were so many different components to keep track of; however, the power supply stands out.
                    I can vividy remember the sense bewilderment that came over me when I pulled out a platora of 
                    varies cables. What's worse, is that I could find nowhere online that just explained clearly what 
                    I needed to know. This is years later, but this is dedicated to anyone who is having the same 
                    struggle I did when searching for this information. I have made it as concise as possible so you
                    can get to gaming ASAP.  
                </p>

                <div class="section-title">power supply? what? why?</div>
                <p>
                    The components that make your personal computer (PC) use Direct Current (DC). The wall electrical 
                    mains in your homes supplies Alternating Current (AC) to the electrical outlets on your walls. If 
                    you supply AC to a component that requires DC, you run the risk of destroying it. 
                    <br><br>
                    The power supply for your PC is responsible for taking the high voltage AC (115v-230v ~ 47-63Hz) 
                    from the wall and converts it to low voltage DC (3.3v-12v Â±5-10%) that your components can use 
                    <em>(Intel, 2018)</em>.
                </p>
                
                <div class="section-title">Connectors</div>
                <div class="section-sub-title">P1 12v Main Connector</div>
                <p>
                    The P1 12v Main Connector is the replacement for the older P8 and P9 connectors. This connector is
                    normally the largest connector. This may be a 20 or 24 pin connector, often you find a 20 pin connector
                    with an extra 4 pin connector attached to facilitate backwards compatibility with older mainboard.
                    Luckily, the pins are keyed, so a 20 pin connector cannot be accidentally inserted into a 24 pin 
                    mainboard incorrectly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This connector plugs into what is usually the largest plug on the mainboard as highlighted below.

                <div class="section-sub-title">CPU Connector</div>
                <p>
                    The CPU connector provides power for the processor. Who would have guessed? It is an 8 pin connector 
                    which usually comes as two attached 4 pin connectors.
                </p>
